# Spotify To Youtube :play:
A simplistic way to find Spotify songs on YouTube.

# How does it work? :wow:
All you gotta do is insert your playlist URL when prompted, then the app will automatically search all songs from that playlist on youtube and return the URLs.

# What did you use to make it? :thinking:
I used the following libraries:<br>
  - <a href="https://github.com/plamere/spotipy">Spotipy (For handling the Spotify API)</a>
  - <a href="https://github.com/rohitkhatri/youtube-python">Youtube Python (For handling the Youtube API)</a>
