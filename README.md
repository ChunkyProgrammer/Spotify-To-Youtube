# Spotify To Youtube â–¶
A simplistic way to find Spotify songs on YouTube.

# How does it work? ðŸ˜®
All you gotta do is insert your <a href="http://www.spotify.com">Spotify</a> playlist URL when prompted, then the app will automatically search all songs from that playlist on <a href="http://youtube.com">Youtube</a> and return the URLs.

# What did you use to make it? :thinking:
I used the following libraries:<br>
  - <a href="https://github.com/plamere/spotipy">Spotipy (For handling the Spotify API)</a>
  - <a href="https://github.com/rohitkhatri/youtube-python">Youtube Python (For handling the Youtube API)</a>

# Why did you make it?
Studying purpouses, and it might actually be useful to someone. I think <a href="http://discord.app">Discord</a> bots could use that to queue songs and stuff.
